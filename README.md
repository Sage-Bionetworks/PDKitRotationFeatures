# PDKit & Rotation Features for Gait Activity

**Author: Aryton Tediarjo, Larsson Omberg**

## About
This repository is used for retrieving gait features from accelerometer and gyroscope data. It acts as a wrapper to an external Python package Parkinson Disease Featurization pacakge called [pdkit](https://github.com/pdkit/pdkit) with an additional QC handling of detecting rotation when user is walking based on [rotation detection paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5811655/).

## Added Functionality
- Additional Error Handling
- Added windowing feature computation
- Added QC on detecting rotation 

## Installation

#### Requirements: 
Python 3 and above

#### Installing as a Github Python Package
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/SageBionetworks/PDKitRotationFeatures.git
```

## Use Case
```python
from PDKitRotationFeatures import gait_module  
featureObjs = gait_module.GaitFeatures(window_size = 256, detect_rotation=True) ##refer to module for additional parameter
featureObjs.run_pipeline(accel sensor data <t,x,y,z>, gyro sensor data <t,x,y,z>)
```

## Feature Dictionary
In the feature processing steps, the module will try to detect rotation given a gyroscope information. After separating the rotation sequence from the longitudinal data, features will be computed in smaller windows (default to 512 ~ around 5 seconds given 100Hz sampling frequency).

These are the features that will be computed:

1. **Number of Steps**: The number of steps in a given window 

2. **Cadence**: The number of steps per window duration

3. **Energy Freeze Index**: Freeze Index is defined as the power in the “freeze” band [3–8 Hz] divided by the power in the “locomotor” band [0.5–3 Hz] [measured in Hz]

4. **Locomotor Freeze Index**: Locomotor freeze index is the power in the “freeze” band [3–8 Hz] added to power in the “locomotor” band [0.5–3 Hz]. [measured in Hz]

5. **Stride-to-Stride/Step-to-Step Features**: Compute step-to-step or stride-to-stride summary statistics (standard deviation, average etc.)


6. **Step/Stride Regularity**: Measure of step/stride regularity along axis [percentage consistency of the step-to-step pattern].

7. **Speed of Gait**: It extracts the gait speed from the energies of the approximation coefficients of wavelet functions. Preferably you should use the magnitude of x, y and z (mag_acc_sum) here, as the time series.

8. **Gait Symmetry**: Measure of gait symmetry along axis [difference between step and stride regularity].

9. **Rotation Speed (Omega)**: Measures rotation speed based on inferred rotation period (radians during inferred rotation period/rotation duration)
